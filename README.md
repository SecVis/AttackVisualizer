# AttackVisualizer 

Network security project for visualizing attacks.

An interactive data visualization of MIT Lincoln Laboratory's DARPA IDS dataset. The project aims to analyses network logs and tcp dumps to shows trends of attacks that occurred on the system in question. The project simplifies the task of getting information of types of common attacks, network traffic flow in a cluster and the most favored time for attacks.
